    "## Likelihood of Student Criminal Activity\n",
    "\n",
    "Using public datasets from the Department of Education, find any correlations between states where children attended preschool, teacher certifications, and criminal offenses ocurring at school.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### DATA INFO\n",
    "- The `teacher_creds` data frame records number and percentage of public school classroom teachers (in full-time equivalents), by certification status and years of experience, by state: School Year 2013-14.\n",
    "- The `preschool` data frame records number and percentage of public school students enrolled in Preschool, by race/ethnicity, disability status, and English proficiency, by state: School Year 2015-16.\n",
    "- The `incidents` data frame records number of incidents, by state: School Year 2015-16.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Caveats:** \n",
    "- Due to limited data available, the teacher credentials data is from school year 2013-2014 while the other two data sets are from 2015-2016.\n",
    "- This would probably be more accurate with several years worth of data as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "This mostly likely means that the results will inherently be inacurrate so this is mostly an exercise of curiosity and should not be interpreted as factual.\n",
