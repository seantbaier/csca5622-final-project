    "- Table reads (for US Totals): Of all 3,138,535 classroom teachers (FTE), 3,084,697 (98.3%) met all state licensing/certification requirements. Data reported in this table represent 100.0% of responding schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Source: U.S. Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights, Civil Rights Data Collection, 2013-14, available at http://ocrdata.ed.gov. Data notes are available at http://ocrdata.ed.gov/downloads/DataNotes.docx*\n",

    "- Due to limited data available, the teacher credentials data is from school year 2013-2014 while the other two data sets are from 2015-2016.\n",
    "- The school incidents data provides a disclaimer at the footer to \"Interpret data in this row with caution. Data are missing for more than 15 percent of schools.\"\n",
    "- This is only one school year's worth of data and would probably be more accurate with several years. \n",
